## 2024-05-14 - Tooltip Hover and Focus Test Coverage
**Bug/Gap:** The `Tooltip` component was missing tests for user interaction events (`onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`), leaving logic that controls tooltip visibility uncovered.
**Root Cause:** Interaction states were initially mocked out or overlooked in standard rendering tests.
**Test Added:** Added explicit `@testing-library/react` tests simulating `mouseEnter`, `mouseLeave`, `focus`, and `blur` events to ensure `wppo-tooltip-container--visible` is correctly added and removed.
