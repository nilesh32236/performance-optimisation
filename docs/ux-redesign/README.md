# Admin UX Overhaul — campaign record

Durable memory. Findings and decisions, not a transcript.

## Objective

Turn the admin SPA from a feature-heavy technical control panel into a clear
administration experience: **Overview / Speed / Media / Data & System / Manage**,
URL-aware navigation, a genuine evidence-based Overview, localized loading
feedback, verified accessibility and responsive behaviour.

## Phase 0 — discovery (complete)

- The active tab was **never in the URL**; sidebar items had no `href`. Proven by
  walking all seven tabs and watching `location.href` never change.
- Seven flat tabs; `file_optimisation` holds **96** settings in a **6,320-line**
  component; `Dashboard` had become a junk drawer holding **13** panels.
- Verified already correct, so not "fixed" again: the dirty-form guard (#850)
  and per-button loading state (#849).

## Phase 1 — information architecture and URL routing

Shipped in #1672, then corrected. See `information-architecture.md` and
`defects-found-and-fixed.md`.

## Phase 2 — Overview (in progress)

`src/lib/overviewStatus.js` derives every Overview fact from data the plugin
already exposes, as a pure module so the rules are directly testable.

**No score.** A composite "92/100" would be decoration: every input is already
weighted by something other than a made-up formula, and "enabled" says nothing
about "working". The model reports discrete states — healthy, attention,
not-configured, unavailable, unknown — and never claims health without evidence.

Two honesty defects were found by its own tests and fixed:

1. the object cache reported **healthy** when reachability was never returned;
2. a site with a working cache and no object cache was reported
   **not-configured** rather than healthy, so a correctly configured minimal
   site looked unconfigured.

A third finding was in my own test: the "no numeric score" assertion
destructured `{ rows, overall }` and then serialised only that subset, so a
`score` property on the model was invisible to it. The assertion now serialises
the whole model and rejects any numeric leaf. Repairing it also exposed an
infinite recursion in the walker — `Object.values('a')` yields `['a']` forever.

## Decisions

1. **Routing first.** Every later phase assumes a stable section identity.
2. **No router dependency.** `pushState` + `popstate`, as the repo has none.
3. **Reuse existing primitives.** #849 and #850 prove they were built correctly.
4. **Group, never delete.**
5. **Verify in a real browser.** Two blank-admin bugs and three critical
   navigation bugs reached a green pipeline; only execution and independent
   review caught them.
6. **Never merge before the independent review returns.** I broke this once: I
   merged #1672 while its review was still running, and it landed with three
   critical defects. See `defects-found-and-fixed.md`.

## Progress

- [x] Phase 0 discovery
- [x] Phase 1 information architecture + URL routing
- [ ] Phase 2 Overview
- [ ] Phase 3 loading/feedback system
- [ ] Phase 4 visual design system
- [ ] Phase 5 accessibility pass
- [ ] Phase 6 live functional validation
- [ ] Phase 7 regression hardening

## Known remaining problems

- A pre-existing console error, `Failed to fetch activities: signal is aborted
  without reason`, fires on navigation. The `aborted` guard does not cover the
  abort reason. Cosmetic; Phase 3.
- `Dashboard` is still a 13-panel junk drawer. Phase 2.
- `FileOptimization` is still 6,320 lines with 96 settings. Phase 4.
- `.wppo-section__title` font-weight is being overridden by an existing more
  specific heading rule; the token set applies, the weight does not. Cosmetic,
  Phase 4.
- Screenshot review via the harness image tool is blocked by a path-permission
  constraint; structural assertions are used instead.

## Next task

Phase 2: the Overview components that render `overviewStatus`, built over
existing endpoints with no new expensive calls.
